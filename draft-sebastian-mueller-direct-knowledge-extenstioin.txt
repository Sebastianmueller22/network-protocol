   Direct Knowledge Extension to the Distance Vector Routing Protocol
                  draft-todo-yourname-protocol-latest

Abstract

   Naive Distance Vector based Routing protocols like RIP (RFC here)
   suffer from a phenomena called the "count-to-infinity problem" in the
   event of a failure event.  This Internet draft extends a naive
   Distance Vector Routing implementation with two simple flags that
   allow the network to recover quickly and reliably, with no chance of
   the count to infinity problem to occurr.

1.  Introduction

   The count to infinity problem occurs when there is a routing loop, so
   two connected paths to the same network node exist and a failure
   event occurs.  The nodes within the loop advertise routes via each
   other to the failed node.  Believing each others advertisements they
   don't notice the failure and continue to route traffic within the
   routing loop, until the advertisments reach an "infinity" value, in
   which case failure is assumed and routing traffic to the failed node
   stops.  This infinity value poses a restriction on the possible size
   of the network, because actual routing costs from one end of the
   network to the other need to remain below that.

   This document introduces two flags to distance vector routing, which
   prevent this problem from occuring.  Therefore the strict limit to
   the size of the network introduced in RIP to limit the impact of the
   count to infinity problem is not needed.  Likewise, split horizon
   with poisoned reverse is not necessary.  The extension is extremely
   simple.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The count to infinity problem

4.  The extension

   Two simple concepts are added to a naive DVR implementation.

   First, we add the convention that if a node doesn't receive a Hello
   message from one of its immediate neighbors for a certain amount of
   time, it tries to contact it with an are-you-there message which
   needs to be acknowledged.  If this remains unanswered, the node
   assumes the neighbor to be down.  It then sends a triggered update on
   all of its interfaces with the route to the down neighbor being set
   to -1, or another, similarly impossible value.  This signals the
   failure event to the rest of the network.  All receiving nodes that
   aren't direct neighbors to the failed node perform the following
   steps:

   *  They write the infinity value into their routing table

   *  They stop routing traffic with the failed node as a target and
      report it to the sender as unreachable

   *  They ignore any regular updates that advertise a live route to the
      failed node

   *  They likewise send a triggered update with this "infinity flag" to
      all their neighbors

   This "bad news" travels with the full speed of triggered updates
   through the network since all regular advertisements reporting it to
   be up are ignored.

   This goes on until a node is reached that has the node in question as
   part of its direct neighbors.  The receiving node then tries to reach
   the failed node.  If it answers, the failure was actually a link
   failure, not a node failure, or the node recovered in the meantime.
   The node that discovers this then sends a triggerd update with a
   "direct-knowledge-bit" set.  Receiving nodes of such an update
   message will:

   *  Write this message into their routing table if they have an
      infinity value in there or an update message with higher cost and
      DKB set, or a regular routing cost (they didn't know about the
      failure yet)

   *  Trigger an update message advertising this new route with the
      direct knowledge bit set to all their neighbors

   *  They start a timeout and retain the DKB until it expires.  Any
      received infinity values within this time and for this node will
      be ignored

   *  They route traffic via the new path

   So the "good news" that it was actually a link failure or the node is
   up again travels just as fast through the network.

   Since in the case of a failure no node will believe an update without
   direct knowledge of the nodes' continuing or regained liveness, count
   to infinity cannot occur.  The best path to the node is discovered as
   soon as the remaining neighbors hear about the failure through the
   triggerd updates and the best remaining path is propagated with the
   speed of triggered updates as well.

5.  Security Considerations

   *  DoS through rouge node

   *  Privacy through advertisement

   *  No authorization by default

   *  etc. etc.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
