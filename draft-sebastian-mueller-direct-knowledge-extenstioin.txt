   Direct Knowledge Extension to the Distance Vector Routing Protocol
                  draft-todo-yourname-protocol-latest

Abstract

   Naive Distance Vector based Routing protocols like RIP (RFC here)
   suffer from a phenomena called the "count-to-infinity problem" in the
   event of a failure.  This Internet draft extends a naive Distance
   Vector Routing implementation with two simple flags that allow the
   network to recover quickly and reliably, with no chance of the count
   to infinity problem to occurr.

1.  Introduction

   The count to infinity problem occurs when there is a routing loop, so
   two connected paths to the same network node exist and a failure
   event occurs.  The nodes within the loop advertise routes via each
   other to the failed node.  Believing each others advertisements they
   don't notice the failure and continue to route traffic within the
   routing loop, counting up, until the advertisments reach an
   "infinity" value, in which case failure is assumed and routing
   traffic to the failed node stops.  This infinity value poses a
   restriction on the possible size of the network, because actual
   routing costs from one end of the network to the other need to remain
   below that.

   This document introduces two flags to distance vector routing, which
   prevent this problem from occuring.  Therefore the strict limit to
   the size of the network introduced in RIP to limit the impact of the
   count to infinity problem is not needed.  Likewise, split horizon
   with poisoned reverse is not necessary.  The extension is extremely
   simple.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Distance Vector Routing - DVR

3.  The count to infinity problem

4.  The extension

   We add the convention that if a node doesn't receive a Hello message
   from one of its immediate neighbors for a certain amount of time, it
   tries to contact it with an are-you-there message which needs to be
   acknowledged.  If this remains unanswered, the node assumes the
   neighbor to be down.  It then sends a triggered update on all of its
   interfaces with the route to the down neighbor being set to -1, or
   another, similarly impossible value.  This signals the failure event
   to the rest of the network.  All receiving nodes that aren't direct
   neighbors to the failed node perform the following steps:

   *  They write the infinity value into their routing table

   *  They stop routing traffic with the failed node as a target and
      report it to the sender as unreachable

   *  They ignore any regular updates that advertise a live route to the
      failed node

   *  They likewise send a triggered update with this "infinity flag" to
      all their neighbors

   This "bad news" travels with the full speed of triggered updates
   through the network since all regular advertisements reporting it to
   be up are ignored.

   This goes on, until a node is reached that has the node in question
   as part of its direct neighbors.  The receiving node then tries to
   reach the failed node.  If it answers, the failure was actually a
   link failure, not a node failure, or the node recovered in the
   meantime.  The node that discovers this then sends a triggerd update
   with a "direct-knowledge-bit" set.  Receiving nodes of such an update
   message will:

   *  Write this message into their routing table if they have an
      infinity value in there or an update message with higher cost and
      DKB set, or a regular routing cost (they didn't know about the
      failure yet)

   *  Trigger an update message advertising this new route with the
      direct knowledge bit set to all their neighbors

   *  They start a timeout and retain the DKB until it expires.  Any
      received infinity values within this time and for this node will
      be ignored

   *  They route traffic via the new path

   So the "good news" that it was actually a link failure or the node is
   up again travels just as fast through the network.

   Since in the case of a failure no node will believe an update without
   direct knowledge of the nodes' continuing or regained liveness, count
   to infinity cannot occur.  The best path to the node is discovered as
   soon as the remaining neighbors hear about the failure through the
   triggerd updates and the best remaining path is propagated with the
   speed of triggered updates as well.

   TODO: this triggered Update thing is cumbersome

5.  Example

   We take as an example the following network topology:

           A
          / \
         /   \
        B-----C
         \   /
          \ /
           D
          / \
         /   \
        E     F
         \   /
          \ /
           G

   When the link between F and G fails, F sends an infinity bit to D.  D
   ignores updates reporting G as up from C,B and E and propagates the
   infinity bit to B,C and E.  E knows that G is its direct neighbor and
   upon receiving the infinity bit, it checks if G is reachable.  Since
   it is, it advertises a route to G via itself with the direct
   knowledge bit set.  Meanwhile B and C have sent the infinity bit to
   A.  D receives the advertisment with the DKB set, ignores the
   infinity bits from F, B and C and propagates this new route to them.
   B and C ignore the infinity bit from A and send new route with the
   DKB to A.

   Now the network has converged to the new available Path to G.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document only tries to solve the count to infinity problem.

   The inherent security risks of DVR, such as rogue nodes advertising
   routes that don't exist, or routes for other nodes to themselves etc.
   apply here as well.

   The two additions made here pose additional security risks.  A rogue
   node could advertise all other nodes as being down, wether they are
   its neighbor or not.  This would effectively halt communication in
   the network for a short time and put significant strain on the
   network while all nodes report their neighbors to still be reachable.

   This is not easily preventable, but can be mitigated with another
   convention, where updates originating from a node need to
   cryptographically signed before sending.

   That way, repeated infinity values from the same node can be ignored
   for a certain time (which might be advisable anyway, in the context
   of unstable links).

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
