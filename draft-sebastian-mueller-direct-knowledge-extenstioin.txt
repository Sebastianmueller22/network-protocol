   Direct Knowledge Extension to the Distance Vector Routing Protocol
                  draft-todo-yourname-protocol-latest

Abstract

   Abstract Naive Distance Vector based Routing protocols like RIP (RFC
   here) suffer from a phenomena called the "count-to-infinity problem"
   in the event of a failure event.  This Internet draft extends the RIP
   with two simple flags that allow the network to recover quickly and
   reliably, with no chance of the count to infinity problem to occurr.
   The basic idea is that the network assumes a node failure in case a
   direct neighbor reports a loss of connection.  All traffic to that
   node is halted and all routing information that still advertises the
   failed node as up is discarded, until a direct neighbor of the node
   reports it to be reachable.  This direct knowledge is flagged in the
   new routing information, making clear that the failure event is
   known, but the advertised route is still available in spite of that.
   Then this new route is propagated through the network and traffic to
   the node resumes via the available link.

1.  Introduction

   The count to infinity problem occurs when there is a routing loop, so
   two connected paths to the same network node exist and a failure
   event occurs.  The nodes within the loop advertise routes via each
   other to the failed node.  Believing each others advertisements they
   don't notice the failure and continue to route traffic within the
   routing loop, until the advertisments reach an "infinity" value, in
   which case failure is assumed and routing traffic to the failed node
   stops.  This infinity value poses a restriction on the possible size
   of the network, because actual routing costs from one end of the
   network to the other need to remain below that.

   This document introduces two flags to distance vector routing, which
   prevent this problem from occuring.  This is, in contrast to for
   example BABEL, not an effort to avoid routing loops.  Two or more
   connected paths to the same node can exist without a problem.  The
   fully self-organising nature of a naive Distance Vector Routing based
   approach is maintained.  A loop in the network topology is no longer
   a problem with this addition.  Therefore the strict limit to the size
   of the network introduced in RIP to limit the impact of the count to
   infinity problem is not needed.  Likewise, split horizon with
   poisoned reverse is not necessary.
